# Uncommon CSS bug: Unexpected div width behavior with float: left

This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to unexpected div width behavior when using `float: left` and the presence of default padding or margin. The bug may manifest in some browsers where the calculated width doesn't accurately reflect the intended 50% width due to the additional space occupied by padding or margin. The solution introduces a reset style to address the issue.
