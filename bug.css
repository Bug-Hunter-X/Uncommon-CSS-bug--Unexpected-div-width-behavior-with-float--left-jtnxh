The following CSS code results in unexpected behavior in certain browsers:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
}
```

This simple code snippet, intended to make two divs occupy 50% of the parent container's width side-by-side, may not work as expected due to the default padding or margin of the `div` elements.
