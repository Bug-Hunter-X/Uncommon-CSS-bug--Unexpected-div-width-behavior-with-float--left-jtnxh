To resolve this issue, you can add a reset style to eliminate the default padding and margin.  Here's a corrected version:

```css
div {
  width: 50%;
  float: left;
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}
```

Alternatively, you could use a CSS reset framework or a more robust layout method (e.g., flexbox or grid) for better cross-browser consistency.
